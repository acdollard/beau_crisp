Everyone steps on the mat for the first time in a different way, you
            see. Some people are very far outside their comfort zone, and their nervous
            energy is palpable. Some people, usually young, athletic guys, step on
            the mat with something to prove and a chip on their shoulder. Most people
            are somewhere in the middle.

And then there was Beau. It only took a glance to see beneath the
            thick cotton gi some serious muscle. Not glamorous, bodybuilding
            muscle, but the subtle kind that comes from developing real skill
            with the body, not just picking up and setting down heavy weights.
            But there was none of the ego, none of the bravado. Just a desire to
            grow. Here was this soft-spoken young man, with soulful brown eyes
            and a grip like a vise.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
He quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with. The
            consummate training partner, eager to learn, with zero chip and yet
            an athletic foundation as strong as anybody's I'd seen. When we
            learned of his background as a master strength and condition
            trainer, he quickly began leading a group of us in weekly
            weight-room workout on Sundays. We would often follow these with
            brunch at a diner nearby, where we would talk philosophy,
            creativity, current events and everything in between. Within a year
            and a half he competed in a national tournament and, I'm not even
            kidding, won three fights and a gold medal <span class="italic" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>with a broken index finger.</span> </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Since then I've gotten to know Beau as a training partner, writer,
            fellow spiritual-seeker, and friend. At what he does, S&C, he is the
            best I've ever met. Bar none. His knowledge of physiology,
            kinesiology and the nervous system is a resource that I've plundered
            many times. But there are so many other reasons to love Beau. He is
            somebody who will never stop trying to learn, never stop seeking
            wisdom and competence, and he's doing it all for the right reason:
            to give back to others and nudge this damn crazy world in a positive
            direction. Yes has big sexy quads and biceps, of course, but do you
            know which of his muscles is even bigger?<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> (That's not a muscle,
            you sicko!)
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
His heart. It's that big ole' heart. He's generous and strong and
            somebody who I plan to keep as a friend for a very, very long time.
            He didn't know I was going to write this. I didn't either, really.
            But it had to be said.
